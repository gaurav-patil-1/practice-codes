***useState Hook*** :

--- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component
--- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application

e.g. :
import React, { useState } from "react";

const UseState = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setColor("blue")}>
        Blue
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default UseState;

--- The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!

--- We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.

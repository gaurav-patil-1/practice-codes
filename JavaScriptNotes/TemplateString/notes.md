--- What are Template Literals?
Template literals are a way to define string literals in JavaScript. Unlike traditional string literals that use single or double quotes, template literals are enclosed in backticks (`).

--- Key Features

1. Multi-line Strings: Enables the creation of multi-line strings without needing escape characters like \n.
2. String Interpolation: Allows for embedding expressions inside the string that will be evaluated when the string is created.
3. Tagged Templates: Can be tagged with a function that processes both the string and the embedded expressions.

--- Syntax

1. Simple String
   `string text`
   Works just like a traditional string, enclosed in backticks.

2. Multi-line String
   `string text line 1
string text line 2`
   No need to use escape characters (\n) for a new line, just press Enter.

3. String with Expressions
   `string text ${expression} string text`
   The ${expression} will be evaluated and its value will be embedded in the string.

4. Tagged Template Literal
   tagFunction`string text ${expression} string text`
   tagFunction is a function that manipulates the string and expressions.

## Examples:

1. Simple String

const simple = `Hello, World!`;

2. Multi-line String

const multi = `Hello,
World!`;

3. String with Expressions

const name = 'Gaurav';
const greeting = `Hello, \${name}!`;

4. Tagged Template Literal

function tag(strings, ...values) {
return strings[0] + values[0].toUpperCase() + strings[1];
}

const name = 'world';
const str = tag\`Hello \${name}\`;
// Output will be "Hello WORLD"

## Parameters:

- string text: This is the string content. Almost all characters are allowed, including line breaks and whitespace.

- expression: This is a JavaScript expression that will be evaluated, and its value will be converted to a string or passed to tagFunction.

- tagFunction: If specified, it gets called with two arguments:

  - An array of all the string parts
  - The evaluated expressions

  The return value of this function will become the new value of the template literal.

## Description:

1. Enclosure: Template literals use backticks (\`) instead of single (') or double (") quotes to enclose strings.

2. Placeholders: Within a template literal, you can embed expressions using \${expression}. These are called placeholders.

3. Default Function: If you don't supply your own tag function, JavaScript uses a default one that simply replaces placeholders with their corresponding values and joins all the strings together.

4. Tagged Templates: If you provide a function right before the template literal (e.g., myFunction in myFunctionHello \${name}\`), that function will process the template literal. This is known as a tagged template.

5. Escaping Characters:

   - Backticks in the string can be escaped using a backslash (\`) before the backtick.
   - Dollar signs can also be escaped to prevent them from being treated as a part of a placeholder.

## Examples:

--- Escaping Backticks

1. To include an actual backtick within a template literal, you can escape it with a backslash.

console.log(\`\` === "\`"); // Output: true

--- Escaping Dollar Sign 2) If you need a string to contain \${1} and not treat it as an expression placeholder, you can escape the dollar sign.

console.log(\`\${1}\` === "\${1}"); // Output: true

In summary, template literals offer a more versatile way to work with strings in JavaScript, allowing for easier multi-line strings, interpolation, and custom processing through tag functions. The escaping rules let you include characters that might otherwise conflict with these features.

## Multi-line Strings in Traditional JavaScript:

In traditional JavaScript strings, which use single or double quotes, you would have to manually insert a newline character (\n) to create multi-line strings. For example:

console.log("string text line 1\n" + "string text line 2");

## Multi-line Strings using Template Literals:

Template literals make it much easier to define multi-line strings. You can simply write the string across multiple lines within the backticks, and the newlines will be part of the resulting string. For example:

console.log(\`string text line 1
string text line 2\`);

This will produce the exact same multi-line output as the traditional example:

string text line 1
string text line 2

As you can see, template literals are far more readable and convenient when you need to define multi-line strings.

## String Interpolation:

--- Traditional Way: Using Addition Operator +
In the old way, you concatenate strings and expressions using the + operator. This can be cumbersome and hard to read when you have multiple expressions.

const a = 5;
const b = 10;
console.log("Fifteen is " + (a + b) + " and\nnot " + (2 \* a + b) + ".");

--- Modern Way: Using Template Literals
Template literals simplify this by allowing you to embed expressions directly into strings using \${expression}.

const a = 5;
const b = 10;
console.log(`Fifteen is \${a + b} and
not \${2 * a + b}.`);

Note:

- Addition Operator: When using +, the operands are first converted to primitives before the operation. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

- Template Literals: In the case of template literals, the expressions inside \${} are directly coerced to strings. This usually makes their behavior more predictable when dealing with different data types.

## Nesting in Template Literals:

Nesting in template literals allows you to embed a template literal within another template literal. This is particularly useful for making complex string manipulations more readable.

--- Without Nested Template Literals:

const timeOfDay = "morning"; // This could be "morning", "afternoon", or "evening"

const greeting = `Good ${timeOfDay === "morning" ? "morning" : timeOfDay === "afternoon" ? "afternoon" : "evening"}, User!`;

--- With Nested Template Literals:

const timeOfDay = "morning"; // This could be "morning", "afternoon", or "evening"

const greeting = `Good \${timeOfDay === "morning" 
  ? "morning" 
  : \` \${timeOfDay === "afternoon" ? "afternoon" : "evening"}\`
}, User!`;

## Tagged Templates in JavaScript:

Tagged templates in JavaScript are an advanced form of template literals that allow you to customize how template literals are processed. By using a tag function, you can control the behavior of a template literal in ways that go beyond simple string substitution.

Anatomy of a Tag Function:
A tag function takes one or more arguments:

- The first argument is an array of all the static strings in the template literal. These are the parts that don't change.
- The remaining arguments are the evaluated expressions from the placeholders \${...} in the template literal.

Here's a simple example:

function myTag(strings, personExp, ageExp) {
// strings = ["That ", " is a ", "."]
// personExp = "Mike"
// ageExp = 28

const ageStr = ageExp > 99 ? "centenarian" : "youngster";

return \`${strings[0]}\${personExp}\${strings[1]}\${ageStr}\${strings[2]}\`;
}

// alternate way: function myTag(strings, ...expression) {};

## Raw Strings in Tagged Templates:

The raw property is available on the first argument of the tag function. This property allows you to get the "raw" form of the strings in the template literalâ€”meaning you'll get the strings exactly as they are entered, without any processing of escape sequences.

e.g. :
function tag(strings) {
console.log(strings.raw[0]);
}

tag\`string text line 1 \\n string text line 2\`;

String.raw() Method:
JavaScript also provides a String.raw() method that can be used to create raw strings. It works similarly to how a default tag function would work when a template literal does not contain any escape sequences.

const str = String.raw\`Hi\\n\${2 + 3}!\`;
// "Hi\\\\n5!"
